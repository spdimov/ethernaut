## Challenge
~~~
The creator of this contract was careful enough to protect the sensitive areas of its storage.

Unlock this contract to beat the level.

Things that might help:

- Understanding how storage works
- Understanding how parameter parsing works
- Understanding how casting works

Tips:

- Remember that metamask is just a commodity. Use another tool if it is presenting problems. Advanced gameplay could involve using remix, or your own web3 provider.

## Contract
```
/ SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Privacy {
    bool public locked = true;
    uint256 public ID = block.timestamp;
    uint8 private flattening = 10;
    uint8 private denomination = 255;
    uint16 private awkwardness = uint16(block.timestamp);
    bytes32[3] private data;

    constructor(bytes32[3] memory _data) {
        data = _data;
    }

    function unlock(bytes16 _key) public {
        require(_key == bytes16(data[2]));
        locked = false;
    }

    /*

}
```

## Solution
Again state variables layout in storage:
Storage:  \[locked\], \[ID\], \[locked\], \[flattening, denomination,awkwardness\], \[data\[0\]\], \[data\[1\]\], \[data\[2\]\]. `data[2]` is placed in the 5th storage slot and the key is first 16 bytes of it.
