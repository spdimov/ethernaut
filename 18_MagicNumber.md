## Challenge
~~~
To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a `Solver`, a contract that responds to `whatIsTheMeaningOfLife()` with the right number.

Easy right? Well... there's a catch.

The solver's code needs to be really tiny. Really reaaaaaallly tiny. Like freakin' really really itty-bitty tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

Hint: Perhaps its time to leave the comfort of the Solidity compiler momentarily, and build this one by hand O_o. That's right: Raw EVM bytecode.

Good luck!

## Contract
```

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MagicNum {
    address public solver;

    constructor() {}

    function setSolver(address _solver) public {
        solver = _solver;
    }

    /*
    ____________/\\\_______/\\\\\\\\\_____        
     __________/\\\\\_____/\\\///////\\\___       
      ________/\\\/\\\____\///______\//\\\__      
       ______/\\\/\/\\\______________/\\\/___     
        ____/\\\/__\/\\\___________/\\\//_____    
         __/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_____/\\\//________

}
```

## Solution

```
contract Hack {
    constructor(IMagicNum target) {
        bytes memory bytecode = hex"69602a60005260206000f3600052600a6016f3";
        address addr;
        assembly {
            // create(value, offset, size)
            addr := create(0, add(bytecode, 0x20), 0x13)
        }
        require(addr != address(0));

        target.setSolver(addr);
    }
}
```
